                        Hello! I'm a software eating three million ton pile of pipes and various
                        trace masses of unknown origin orbiting an unknown planet on the edge of
                        the Somersloop system. I have been transmitting radio patterns with seemingly
                        random patterns with no known meaning; that is until 1959, when the Luna 1
                        pickced up faint radio signals from the core of the moon which matched my
                        transmissions perfectly. Since then, for reasons undisclosed to the public, worldwide government space organizations
                        have been trying to forcibly eject the moon from earth's orbit.
